# Mobile Project for Nokia (hobby-clubs-events)
This App is a prototype for Nokia company done by Metropolia students as Mobile project course.
As this project was assigned to us and it's part of MyCampus app we decided that, we use 100% Kotlin using Jetpack compose. 
This app will help Nokia employees during their free time to check out the hobby clubs and events that organised by Nokia or the employees. 
Also in this app you can create, join clubs and events and share the news of the app.

Application was designed and developed using Android Studio, Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Git, and Figma.
